                        <h2>What is a Chatbot?</h2>
                        <p>
                            A chatbot is an AI-powered software application designed to simulate human conversation through text or voice interactions. Think of chatbots as digital assistants that can understand your questions, process your requests, and provide helpful responses 24/7. From customer service on websites to voice assistants like Siri and Alexa, chatbots have become an integral part of our digital experience.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h2>Why Build Chatbots?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Chatbots offer tremendous value for both businesses and users:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>24/7 Availability:</strong> Unlike human agents, chatbots can provide instant responses at any time of day</li>
                            <li><strong>Cost Efficiency:</strong> Reduce customer service costs while handling multiple conversations simultaneously</li>
                            <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Provide consistent, accurate information every time</li>
                            <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Handle thousands of conversations without additional staff</li>
                            <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Gather valuable insights about user preferences and common questions</li>
                            <li><strong>Improved User Experience:</strong> Provide quick answers and guide users through processes</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h2>Types of Chatbots</h2>
                        <p>

                                <strong>Rule-Based Chatbots:</strong> Follow predetermined rules and decision trees. They work well for simple, structured conversations but struggle with unexpected inputs.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>AI-Powered Chatbots:</strong> Use machine learning and natural language processing to understand context and provide more flexible responses.
                            </li>
                            <li>

                                <strong>Voice Chatbots:</strong> Interact through speech rather than text, like virtual assistants.
                            </li>
                            <li>

                                <strong>Entity Extraction:</strong> Identifies specific pieces of information like dates, names, or locations within user messages.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Dialogue Management:</strong> Maintains context throughout a conversation and determines appropriate responses.
                            </li>
